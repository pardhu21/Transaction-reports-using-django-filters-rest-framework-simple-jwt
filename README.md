# Group-3-Custom-Transaction-Report



## About

This web application shows various reports such as product volume, product value, customer value and customer volume.
This app consists of a fully functional REST API  with user authenctication and JWT authentication implemented in it, so if you are looking for a REST API for pratice in your front-end this project can be very helpful.
By understanding this project you can get a good idea on how to make a pretty simple and straight forward REST API with filters and JWT authentication and how to retrive data from a REST API and mant more.

## Getting started
Activate your virtual environment or create a new one.
Read more about it here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html

Then open the folder where you desire to clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/pardhu21/Transaction-reports-using-django-filters-rest-framework-simple-jwt.git
cd Transaction-reports-using-django-filters-rest-framework-simple-jwt
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd Custom_transaction_reports
python manage.py runserver
(or)
python3 manage.py runserver

```

Now your server should be up and running

## Host of your server

Django runs server on 8000 host on default but if for some reason you need to runserver on different host you can simply chage BASE_URL in auditor views.

## Status

There are few noted bugs but they do not break the entire thing so they were ignored.

You can take them as challenges by finding and solving them.


Happy coding.
